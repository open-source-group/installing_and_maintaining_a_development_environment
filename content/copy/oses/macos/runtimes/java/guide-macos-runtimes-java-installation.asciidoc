Maintaining Java on MacOS is a bit complicated.
Apple preinstalls a Java Development Kit package.
And maintains it through it's integrated update process.
This means that you'll have the latest version of the Oracle JDK.
Unfortunately Apple doesn't provide a simple way to downgrade or keep previous versions.
But, we'll provide instructions here.

== Oracle JDK
=== Manual Installation
Applying all updates from Apple will ensure you have the latest Oracle JDK.
This can be done through the Apple Appstore.
This can be found in your Applications folder on your Dock.

Then open your Appstore.

In the Appstore, click Updates in the top menu.

If you see any updates for MacOS, install them.
The details for each update should explain what is included.

You can also see a history of previous patches.
Since I've been a good boy, you can see I have no pending patches.

But what is you need an earlier version?
Or even an unreleased version?
Well, http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/archive-139210.html[Oracle has an archive of all Java runtimes for all supported OSes].

Simply click the version you need.
This will take you to a page to download an installer specific to your OS.
Make sure to accept the license agreement with the radio button at the top of the list of downloads.

For MacOS you'll get a DMG file. Simply double click it to mount.
MacOS should automatically open the disc image and show you a Finder window with a PKG file.


If you're not familiar, PKG files are modifications to MacOS.
Installing Java does require some changes to the system.
